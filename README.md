# Mergeable

Mergeable is a method of creating collaborative coding exercises that focuses on streamlining the teaching process.
Currently, our goal is to create a collaborative text-editor in which you can see updates in real time.
From there we would like to focus on creating the method of designing and implementing custom coding workshops.

## Current State

Mergeable is currently a series of webpages that host Ace's text-editor.
